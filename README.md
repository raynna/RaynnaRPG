RaynnaRPG is an exciting new RPG-style mod for Minecraft, currently under development for NeoForge 1.21.1. This mod introduces level-based restrictions for mining, using tools, crafting with materials, and smelting resources, adding a deeper layer of progression to the game. With each skill tied to its own experience and level requirements, players must level up to unlock access to more advanced materials and tools, creating a rewarding and challenging progression system.

RaynnaRPG is a fresh project with plans to expand to more Minecraft versions in the future, giving players an evolving experience as they advance through the game.
